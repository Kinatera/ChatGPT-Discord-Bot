# ChatGPT-Discord-Bot
I've been searching around for a discord bot that's simple, replies to every message, and is easily configurable. (Whilst also using the cheaper GPT 3.5 Turbo model) But I wasn't able to find any, I only found ones that replied to commands and had no chat history. So I took tidbits of code from everywhere, pieced it together and viola!
